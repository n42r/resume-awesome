%I excel in delivering cutting-edge solutions that drive business growth and enhance user experiences 

%With over 15 years of experience in technology innovation, I have led successful initiatives in AI, data architecture, e-commerce, robotics, and more across startups, global corporations, and large-scale R\&D projects. Anchored by advanced academic credentials--including a recent PhD in data architecture and management--I blend hands‑on expertise with a leadership style centered on exploration, experimentation, and strategic risk‑taking. This diverse background enables me to drive business growth and deliver state‑of‑the‑art solutions that elevate user experiences.

%I am a technology leader with 15+ years of experience driving innovation across AI, data architecture, and large-scale e-commerce systems. My career spans startups, global enterprises, and multi-million Euro R\&D initiatives, where I have successfully built high-impact solutions and led cross-functional teams. Currently, as Lead Solutions Architect at PUMA’s Global E-Commerce Engineering, I focus on building technical organizations and fostering cross-team collaboration. I founded the Technical Cats of E-Commerce, an initiative that drives architectural strategy, innovation, and technical design excellence across multiple teams. 

%My expertise includes AI-driven applications, next-generation data architectures, and pragmatic problem-solving in complex, high-stakes environments. I thrive in ambiguity, balancing rapid experimentation with disciplined execution to turn technical vision into business impact.
