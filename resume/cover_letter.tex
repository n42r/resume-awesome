%Dear Hiring Team,

\vspace{2ex}

I have been pursuing technology innovation for 20+ years, where I led countless successful initiatives spanning diverse domains (AI, data architecture, E-commerce, robotics, mobile apps, games) and settings, such as:

\begin{itemize}

\item Start-up B2C environments 
\item Global corporate headquarters
\item Multi‑million EU publicly funded R\&D projects
\item and many self-started and collaborative initiatives

\end{itemize}

At the same time my education background allowed me to master a variety of topics in the field. In 2023 I completed a PhD in which I invented a data architecture for inter-organizational data sharing and exchange. 15 years ago, I completed a Masters degree in logic-based AI and cognitive robotics and a Bachelors degree in Engineering with a graduation project in machine learning (integrating structured knowledge into case-based reasoning).

Before joining PUMA in 2024, while in the last years of my PhD, I spent a lot of time exploring LLM-powered use-cases, and applications. I built MuzeAI, a prototype of a music recommendation service driven by a user’s Spotify account \see{https://github.com/n42r/muze-ai}, as well as doing feasibility studies for two different start-ups (none materialized). 

I started my career in 2011 building Artificial Intelligence players for mobile games and since then I have been leading initiatives that deliver state-of-the-art technical solutions that drive business growth and elevate user experiences.

My diverse background, curiosity, and drive have led me across a spectrum in the technology universe: from delivering highly reliable E-Commerce systems that serve 100s of PUMA subsidiaries around the world, to doing highly technical and theoretical AI research, and many things in between.
 
My leadership approach for staying ahead in technology is about exploration and experimentation: not iterations over the same concept (as in software engineering), but cycles exploring completely different solution directions until one hits a promising lead.

This approach is based on my view of the "exponential law" in the modern tech industry, which was driven by my personal experiences as well as a study of the history of the tech industry post-2000+.

When it comes to building teams and organizations, I see it as an interplay between two forces: organizational culture and people. And building a high performance organization is always possible with the right balance of open mindedness, courage, experimentation, and trust. And I believe I have a healthy dose of these four.

My experiences at PUMA global Ecomm (from 2024 to present) have given me a good understanding of the company’s value chain along with its rich world-wide network of regions. 

As Director AI and Machine Learning, I believe I have the experience and traits to deliver maximum growth and value to PUMA’s strategy in general and in helping realize the vision of the AI and Machine Learning division.

Sincerely,\\
	
Nasr Kasrin
